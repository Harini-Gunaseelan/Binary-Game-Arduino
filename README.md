## Description
This is an interactive Binary Number Guessing Game implemented using an Arduino. The game generates a random decimal number, and the player has to convert it to binary and input the binary digits using push buttons.

## Features
- Generates random decimal numbers from 0 to 15.
- Player inputs binary digits using push buttons (0 and 1).
- 'Backspace' button to correct mistakes.
- 'Enter' button to submit the answer.
- OLED display for user interaction and feedback.
- LEDs and buzzer for indicating correct and incorrect answers.

## Components Used

- Red LED (Wrong Answer Indicator)
- Buzzer (Optional, for sound feedback)
- Resistors (10kΩ, 100Ω)
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires

## How to Play
1. The OLED screen will display a random decimal number between 0 and 15.
2. Enter the corresponding binary digits using the '0' and '1' buttons.
3. Use the 'Backspace' button if you make a mistake.
4. Press the 'Enter' button to submit your answer.
5. The Green LED will light up if the answer is correct, otherwise, the Red LED will light up.
